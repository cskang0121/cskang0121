Hi there 👋

I'm Kang, a Computer Science Undergraduate who intends to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and a second major in Business Analytics at Singapore Management University. 

> "It always seems impossible until it is done." ― Nelson Mandela. 

Learning programming skills and Mathematics from scratch was effortful to me at first. However, throughout these years, I have learned the importance of being patient, enjoying the process of exploring and learning new technologies, and having the determination to achieve my personal goals by accepting new challenges. 

I get really excited about chances where I get to apply my knowledge and work with passionate and like-minded individuals in the tech industries. If you are interested in connecting with me, please reach me via [email](kang.chinshen@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](kang.chinshen@gmail.com)! 

Peace ✌🏻

Hi there 👋

I'm Kang, a Computer Science Undergraduate who intends to specialize in Artificial Intelligence and a second major in Business Analytics at Singapore Management University.

Learning programming skills and Mathematics from scratch was effortful for me at first. However, throughout these years, I have learned the importance of being patient, enjoying the process of learning, and achieving my personal goals through a strong sense of determination and resilience.

By the way, I get really excited about chances where I get to apply my knowledge and work with passionate and like-minded individuals in the tech industries! If you are interested in connecting with me, please reach me via [email](kang.chinshen@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](kang.chinshen@gmail.com). 

Peace ✌🏻
